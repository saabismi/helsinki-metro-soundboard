# Helsinki Metro soundboard
 
This is a desktop program which you can use to play Helsinki Metro announcements and some train sounds.

It is intended to have global keyboard shortcuts so you can play them at the right moment while in a game for example.

Actually this is usable only for my fictional metro line in the Minecraft server called Nordale in the town of Enso-Svetogorsk. I suggest you to check that out in nordale.pw
